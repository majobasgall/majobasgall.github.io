        <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Hello, I'm Maria Jose Basgall, but everyone calls me Majo. Originally from Argentina, I am a passionate data scientist with a background in machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization. I finished my PhD in Computer Science in May 2022, with a strong technical focus on Big Data preprocessing using technologies such as Spark, Scala, and Python. I am eager to embark on a rewarding career in Data Science or related roles, leveraging my previous experience to provide actionable insights and recommendations that improve decision-making. I thrive in collaborative environments, both sharing my skills and embracing new ones.</p>
        <p>Aside from my technical skills, I enjoy capturing moments through photography. You can check out some of my photos in my <a href="https://example.com/photo-gallery">photo gallery</a>.</p>
        <p>When I'm not diving into data or behind the camera, you can find me practicing pilates mat, which allows me to stay active and centered no matter where I am. I find it not only beneficial for physical health but also for mental well-being.</p>
        <p>I'm also an active and social person who enjoys outdoor activities like cycling, running, and exploring nature. Since I'm living in Switzerland these experiences are enhanced, with its stunning landscapes and endless opportunities for exploration. </p>
     <p>Traveling is another passion of mine. I have been fortunate to explore some extraordinary wonders around the world. From visit the breathtaking waterfalls in Argentina and Brazil, witnessing the captivating auroras in Finland and marveling at the magnificent pyramids in Egypt, to immersing myself in the rich cultures of Spain, Italy, Germany, France and the UK. These experiences have broadened my horizons and deepened my appreciation for the diversity of our world.</p>

        <p>Additionally, I've always been drawn to Linux distributions. Exploring different distributions and tinkering with various setups has been a long-standing hobby of mine. I find the flexibility and freedom that Linux offers truly captivating.</p>

        <p>I believe that collaboration and teamwork are essential for success. I thrive in an environment where ideas are shared, diverse perspectives are valued, and everyone works together towards a common goal.</p>
        <p>I'm excited about the opportunity to leverage my skills and experience to contribute to impactful projects and make a positive difference. Feel free to reach out to me through the contact page if you'd like to connect or discuss potential collaborations.</p>
