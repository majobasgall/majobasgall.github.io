    <div class="about-me">
        <p>
            Hi!, I'm <strong>María José Basgall</strong>, originally from <strong>Argentina</strong>. I'm a
            passionate <strong>data scientist</strong> with a background in <strong>machine learning</strong>,
            <strong>statistical
                analysis</strong>, and <strong>data visualization</strong>. I finished my <strong>PhD</strong> in
            <strong>Computer Science</strong> in May 2022, with a strong technical focus on <strong>Big Data
            preprocessing</strong> using technologies such as <strong>Spark</strong>, <strong>Scala</strong>,
            and <strong>Python</strong>. Throughout my academic journey, I have worked on several interesting <a
                href="#projects"><strong>projects</strong></a> and published several <a
                href="#papers"><strong>papers</strong></a>. I'm eager to embark on a rewarding career in <strong>Data
            Science</strong>
            or related roles, leveraging my previous experience to provide <strong>actionable insights</strong> and
            <strong>recommendations</strong> that improve decision-making. I thrive in <strong>collaborative
            environments</strong>, both sharing my skills and embracing new ones.

            <p>Aside from my technical skills, I enjoy capturing moments through <strong>photography</strong>. You can
                check out some of my photos in my <a href="#gallery"><strong>photo
                    gallery</strong></a>. And, when I'm not diving into data or behind the camera, you can find me
                practicing <strong>pilates</strong>
                mat, which allows me to stay active and centered no matter where I am. I find it not only
                beneficial for physical health but also for mental well-being. I'm also an active and social person who
                enjoys <strong>outdoor
                    activities</strong> like
                cycling, running, and exploring nature. Since <strong>I'm living in
                    Switzerland</strong> these experiences are enhanced, with its stunning landscapes and endless
                opportunities for
                exploration.</p>

            <p><strong>Traveling</strong> is another passion of mine. I have been fortunate to explore some
                extraordinary wonders around
                the world. From visit the breathtaking waterfalls in <strong>Argentina</strong> and
                <strong>Brazil</strong>, witnessing the captivating auroras in <strong>Finland</strong> and marveling at
                the magnificent
                pyramids in <strong>Egypt</strong>, to immersing myself in the rich cultures of <strong>Spain</strong>
                (where I lived for 6 months), <strong>the UK</strong> (where I stayed for 2 months),
                <strong>Italy</strong>, <strong>Mexico</strong>, <strong>Germany</strong>, <strong>France</strong>, and
                more. These experiences have broadened my horizons and deepened my appreciation
                for the diversity of our world.</p>

            <p>Additionally, I've always been drawn to <strong>Linux distributions</strong>. Exploring different
                distributions and tinkering with various setups has been a long-standing hobby of mine. I find the
                flexibility and freedom that Linux offers truly captivating.</p>

            <p>I believe that <strong>collaboration and teamwork</strong> are essential for success. I thrive in an
                environment where
                ideas are shared, diverse perspectives are valued, and everyone works together towards a common
                goal.</p>

            <p>I'm excited about the opportunity to leverage my skills and experience <strong>to contribute to impactful
                projects and make a positive difference</strong>. Feel free to reach out to me through the contact options in the menu bar
                if you'd like to connect or discuss potential collaborations.</p>
